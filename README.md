# Repo Summary

A collection of web development creations available to download and use as desired. Each design is in its own respective folder, and each folder has its own respective **README.md** file containing additional information on layout designs, supporting files, modification notes/tips, and known bugs.

> A short summary about each design layout and the programming languages used.

<div id="id-basic"></div>
#### Basic Web

As the name implies, the **Basic Web** layout is only programmed in HTML/CSS without the use of Bootstrap, making it an unresponsive layout. The home page was designed to be center-aligned and contains mainly links. Any additional page uses a floating box styled design. Header fonts are cursive and the color scheme uses a shade of ivory for the background and a darker shade of gray as a primary color.

<div id="id-Pbox"></div>
#### Plain Box

The **Plain Box** design is programmed in HTML/CSS with the use of Bootstrap, making it a responsive layout. There is minimal use of PHP included. The home page was designed to contain relevant information about the individual including education, work history, and skills. Color scheme and overall design is still debatable as it is being remodeled.

<div id="id-minimal"></div>
#### Center-Minimal

The **Center-Minimal** design is programmed in HTML/CSS with the use of Bootstrap, making it a responsive layout. There is minimal use of JQuery and PHP included. All pages are center-aligned horizontally and vertically. The home page was designed to contain a short description of the individual and all relevant links in a compact and clean look. The color scheme uses a light shade of blue as a primary color and a light shade of green as a secondary color.

### Updates

- **Plain Box** style is still under development so it is currently an incomplete design
- Template code for the **Center-Minimal** styls is currently being adjusted for upload.

### Notes

Currently, all designs are geared towards those who desire a personal website and are looking for design inspirations, or those who are still new to programming and would enjoy a template to use. Since this repo is open source, there is no limitations on what can be taken, used, shared, or modified (there's no stopping you anyways). 

If used, please consider referencing or crediting this repo. I have worked hard on designing, developing, and testing these layouts to practice my skills and to experiment with different programming languages along the way. Please do not sell or attempt to sell any designs taken from this repo. Just like how changing the color of Donald Duck's feathers to anything but white, or changing his outfit color to anything but blue, or changing his outfit entirely does not make him a new character, please note that changing color schemes, font styles, or any minor changes to each design does not make it a "new" layout. Therefore, **do not** plagiarize it and make it your own to **sell**. 

### Fun Fact

I am a text-heavy person so I tend to prefer text-based designs over image-based designs. The main reason is because I am not a photogenic individual, and I only like using images that I personally take myself, which is currently none.

I also prefer multi-page designs over one page designs. However, my next layout will most likely be one page.
